Using the lm function, perform regression analysis and measure independent variables on two datasets.

__**First Data Set**__
The first data set is heart rate.
First create the data set.
```{r}
x = c(18,23,25,35,65,54,34,56,72,19,23,42,18,39,37)
y = c(202,186,187,180,156,169,174,172,153,199,193,174,198,183,178) 
```

Plot x and y with regression line and basic values of regression analysis
```{r}
plot(x,y)
lm_age = lm(y ~ x)
lm_age
abline(lm_age)
summary(lm_age)


```

Find that the resulting equation is more like this:

$MaxHR = -0.7977 + 210.0485$ 

As you can see in summary(lm_age) you have a hypothesis test calculated by R.
```{r}
summary(lm_age)
```
It does not look like it is significant.
