__**Question 1**__

Write a program to computer the derivative of $f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2$. The function should take in a value of x and return back an approximation to the derivate of f(x) evaluated at the value.

```{r}
question1 <- function(x){
  ((x^3) + 2*x^2)
}

derivative1 <- function(x){}
body(derivate1) <- D(body(derivative1), 'x')
```
