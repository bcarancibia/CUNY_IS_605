__*Problem Set 1*__

__1__
When you roll a fair die there are $6^3$ which is 216 possible outcomes. 

__2__
The probability of getting a sum total of 3 when you roll a die two times is first $(1,2)$ then $(2,1)$.
So there are $2/36$ changes of getting it, which reduces to $1/18$.

__3__
If you are in a room of 25 people the probability that two of them have the same birthday is:
$$\frac{365!}{365^{25}(340)!}$$
This is based on the assumption that all birthdays are equally as likely and equal to $1/365$.
If you add 25 people so that are 50 people in the room
$$\frac{365!}{365^{50}(315)!}$$

Results:
```{r}
birthday <- function(n){
   return (1 - (prod(365:((365-n)+1))/(365^n)))
}

birthday(25)
birthday(50)
```
