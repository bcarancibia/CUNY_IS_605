#Problem Set 1
###Question 1
Rank of Matrix A is 4 since there are 4 linearly indepedent rows. None of the rows can be written as a linear combination(quick explanation of linear independence for my reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence).

###Question 2
Given an mxn matrix where m > n then the maximum rank is n, you cannot have more than n linearly independent rows since m > n. Assuming matrix is a non-zero, the minimum rank is 1.

###Question 3
The rank of matrix B is 1.

##### Question 3 #####
matrix_q3 <- matrix(c(1,2,1,3,6,3,2,4,2), byrow=T, nrow=3)
rankMatrix(matrix_q3)[1]
```
