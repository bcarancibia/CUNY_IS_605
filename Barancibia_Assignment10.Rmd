**Playing with PageRank**

**Bullet 1**

Form the $A$ Matrix.

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(0, 0, .33, 0, 0, 0, .5, 0, .33, 0, 0, 0, .5, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
              .5, 1, 0, 0, .33, .5, 0 ,0, 0, 0, 0, .5, .5, 0), nrow=6,ncol=6)

A


```

Introduce Decay and form the B Matrix.

```{r}
n <- 6 #chose 6 because there are 6 pages in the notes
B = 0.85*A+(0.15/n)

B
```

**Bullet 2**

Start uniform rank r and perform power iterations on B til convergence.
```{r}
r <- matrix(c(.167, .167, .167, .167, .167, .167), nrow=6, ncol=1)
r

r_solve1 = (B^10)%*%r
r_solve2 = (B^100)%*%r
r_solve3 = (B^1000)%*%r

```

**Bullet 3**
